                    multi-disciplined as it helps people resonate with the ideas or products. 
                    Finding the best outcome will further motivate to pursue a higher level of 
                    creativity. A successful designer learns from the mistakes of yesterday and 
                    then brings a new mindset to solve the problem at hand. As technology develops 
                    there can still be nothing as fresh a human-centred and human-designed solution 
                    - there will be a question of the future of interactive designers. Human thought
                     is irreplaceable.</div>
